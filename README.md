# Movie_Data_Manager

The SQL Query is in the SQLQuery File. Though it should be noted that i used a package in .NET that automatically creates the seeds and migrations and connects the server to the database.

The server was spun up using IIS express on port 5000. It will initially load to localhost:5000 but will not display data unless you go to localhost:5000/api/Movie
